                        <p className='text-lg leading-[23px] text-[#5B5B5B]'>Ahmad has worked with US startups for over a decade, leading Bizops, Finance and Engineering teams with a global workforce. Heâ€™s extremely excited about connecting exceptional global talent with top tier companies and thinks of recruiting as a full cycle journey that ends not on a start date, but with enduring employee retention. Companies are made on the foundation of their talent, and the right people in the right roles at the right stage of company can create absolute magic. Most recently Ahmad was CEO of an 8 figure telehealth business that he scaled and exited.</p>
